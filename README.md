# The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal (pre-alpha)

<%(TOC)%>

Welcome to the SpatialOS and GDK for Unreal community.

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the GDK for Unreal, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/311273633307951114/339471548647866368) or talk to us on the **Feedback** section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the **unreal-gdk** tag - [this link](https://forums.improbable.io/new-topic?category=Feedback&tags=unreal-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag). You can also [sign up for SpatialOS GDK for Unreal updates](http://go.pardot.com/l/169082/2018-06-15/27ld2t) direct to your mailbox.

#### What's the GDK for Unreal all about?
The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal is an Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) [module](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/UnrealBuildSystem/ModuleFiles) made by Improbable. You can use the GDK for Unreal to integrate persistent multiplayer worlds into your Unreal game using the SpatialOS platform. Find out more about the GDK for Unreal in [our blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/spatialos-unreal-gdk-pre-alpha).

## Recommended use
We are releasing the GDK in [pre-alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) so we can react to feedback and iterate on development quickly. To facilitate this, during our pre-alpha stage we don't have a formal deprecation cycle for APIs and workflows. This means that everything and anything can change. In addition, documentation is limited and some aspects of the GDK are not optimized.

Given this, we don’t recommend using the the GDK for Unreal for games in the production phase just yet.

**Who is it for?**<br>
We recommend you start using the GDK if:

* You don’t mind the rough edges and are interested in contributing to the GDK (see our [contributions]({{urlRoot}}/contributing) policy).
* You want to start evaluating the GDK or prototyping on it for a future project.

Although every feature you need to build your optimal SpatialOS game may not be ready yet, this is a great time to get involved and shape the GDK for Unreal. We are committed to improving the GDK rapidly, aiming for an alpha release in Fall 2018.

## Feature List
See the [full feature list]({{urlRoot}}/features) for what is supported in the GDK for Unreal.

**NOTE:** This link may give you a 404. 
In order to get access to this fork, you need to link your GitHub account to a verified Epic Games account, and to have agreed to Epic's license. You will not be able to use the GDK for Unreal without doing this first. To do this, see the [Unreal documentation](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github).

## SpatialOS Documentation
* For guidance on SpatialOS concepts see the documentation on the [SpatialOS website](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos). <br/>
* For information on the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal, we recommend you use the [GDK documentation on the SpatialOS website](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/pre-alpha/index), however, you can look at the [documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/tree/master/docs).

## Troubleshooting
Run into problems? See the [troubleshooting]({{urlRoot}}/content/troubleshooting) documentation.

## Support
We are not supporting the pre-alpha release for game development, as this version is for evaluation only. However, please give us your [feedback](#give-us-feedback).

## Roadmap
See the [latest roadmap (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/7wtbtwmL/unreal-gdk-roadmap) and let us know what you'd like to see in there.

## Unreal Engine changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single server engine to a distributed model, we had to make a small number of changes to UE4 code. We will attempt to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in our forked [Unreal Engine repo, `4.19-SpatialOSUnrealGDK` branch](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine/tree/4.19-SpatialOSUnrealGDK).
