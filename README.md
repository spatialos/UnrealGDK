# The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Engine (Alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS and GDK (Game Development Kit) for Unreal community.

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the GDK for Unreal, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/311273633307951114/339471548647866368) or talk to us on the **Feedback** section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the **unreal-gdk** tag - [this link](https://forums.improbable.io/new-topic?category=Feedback&tags=unreal-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag). You can also [sign up for SpatialOS GDK for Unreal updates](http://go.pardot.com/l/169082/2018-06-15/27ld2t) direct to your mailbox.

#### What is SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Engine?
The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Engine is an Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) [plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Plugins) made by Improbable. You can use the GDK to make use of multiple Unreal servers in a single game instance using the SpatialOS platform, unlocking the ability to implement large scale, complex and persistent worlds. Find out more about the GDK in [our blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/spatialos-unreal-gdk-pre-alpha).

* Version: Alpha (Stability and performance improvements pending)
* GDK Repository: [github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK)

# Documentation
* For information on the GDK, we recommend you use the [GDK documentation on the SpatialOS website](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/pre-alpha/index).
* For guidance on SpatialOS concepts see the documentation on the [SpatialOS website](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos). <br/>

## Recommended use
We are releasing the GDK in [alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) so we can react to feedback and iterate on development quickly. To facilitate this, during our alpha stage we don't have a formal deprecation cycle for APIs and workflows. This means that everything and anything can change. In addition, documentation is limited and some aspects of the GDK are not optimized.

Given this, for now we recommend using the GDK in projects in early production or prototype stage. This would ensure that your project's requirements are in line with the GDK's timeline.

Although the GDK is not fully ready in terms of performance and stability yet, this is a great time to get involved and shape it with us. We are committed to improving the GDK rapidly, aiming for a beta release in Q1 2019.

## Troubleshooting
Run into problems? See the [troubleshooting](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/content/troubleshooting) documentation.

## Support
We are not supporting the pre-alpha release for game development, as this version is for evaluation only. However, please give us your [feedback](#give-us-feedback).

## Roadmap
See the [latest roadmap (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/7wtbtwmL/unreal-gdk-roadmap) and let us know what you'd like to see in there.

## Unreal Engine changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single server engine to a distributed model, we had to make a small number of changes to UE4 code. We will attempt to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in our forked [Unreal Engine repo, `4.20-SpatialOSUnrealGDK` branch](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine/tree/4.20-SpatialOSUnrealGDK).
