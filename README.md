# The SpatialOS Unreal GDK readme (pre-alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS and Unreal GDK community.

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the Unreal GDK, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/311273633307951114/339471548647866368) or talk to us on the **Feedback** section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the **unreal-gdk** tag - [this link](https://forums.improbable.io/new-topic?category=Feedback&tags=unreal-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag).

#### What's the Unreal GDK all about?
The **SpatialOS Unreal GDK** is an Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) module made by Improbable. You can use the Unreal GDK to integrate persistent multiplayer worlds into your Unreal game using the SpatialOS platform.

## Recommended use
This pre-alpha version software and its documentation is, by its very nature, rough and ready; every part of it is subject to change and it isn’t optimised for performance.

This release is for evaluation and feedback only, with limited documentation; we aren’t supporting any game development on the pre-alpha version of the Unreal GDK.

**Who is it for?** <br>
This pre-alpha release is for experienced Unreal developers who have some understanding of [SpatialOS concepts](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos), and want to give early feedback.

## Installation and setup
For prerequisites, installation and setup, see the [Installation and setup](docs/setup-and-installing.md) documentation.

## Roadmap

TODO add roadmap

## Unreal Engine changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single server engine to a distributed model, we had to make a small number of changes to UE4 code. We will attempt to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in our forked [Unreal Engine repo, `UnrealEngine419_SpatialGDK` branch](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealEngine/tree/UnrealEngine419_SpatialGDK). <br/>
