## :clipboard: Example



```js
const oneByOne = require("one-by-one");

// Call these functions one by one
oneByOne([
    cb => {
        setTimeout(function () {
            cb(null, "Hello World");
        }, 1000);

            cb(new Error("Some error"));
        }, 100);
    }
  , cb => {
        // This will NOT be triggered because the
        // previous sent an error
        cb(null, null);
    }
], (err, data) => {
    console.log(err, data);
    // => [Error: Some error] [ 'Hello World' ]
});

// Call these functions one by one
oneByOne([
    Math.random() > 0.5 ? next => {
        console.log("Generated a random number greater than 0.5.");
        next();
    } : null

        () => cb(null, "Hello World")
      , 1000
    )
  , (cb, prev) => setTimeout(
        () => cb(null, prev.replace("World", "Mars"))
      , 1000

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
