When your deployment has launched, SpatialOS automatically opens the [Console](https://console.improbable.io) in your browser.

In the Console, Select **Launch** on the left of the page, and then select the **Launch** button that appears in the centre of the page to open the SpatialOS Launcher. The Launcher automatically downloads the game client for this deployment and runs it on your local machine.

<%(#Expandable title="What is the SpatialOS Launcher?")%>

The Launcher is a distribution tool which downloads and launches game clients for your deployment. You access the Launcher from the Console; use the Console to create a URL to give end-users access to a game client for your game.

**Congratulations!**

You've successfully set up and launched the Starter Template and the GDK! You are now ready to start developing a game with SpatialOS.

If you have an existing Unreal multiplayer project, follow our detailed [porting guide]({{urlRoot}}/content/tutorials/tutorial-porting-guide) to get it onto the GDK.
