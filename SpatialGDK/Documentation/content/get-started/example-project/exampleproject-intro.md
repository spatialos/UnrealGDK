# The GDK Example project 

This guide takes you through setting up the [Example project](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDKExampleProject); you will launch a single-server local deployment to test the project on your development machine, and you will launch a single-server deployment in the cloud to test and share the project. 

The project contains gameplay and assets that are representative of a basic first-person shooter running on SpatialOS. If you want to make your own project from scratch, use the [Starter Template]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/gdk-template).

Before starting this tutorial you need to have completed the following guides:

- [Get started: 1 - Get the dependencies]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies)
- [Get started: 2 - Get and build the SpatialOS Unreal Engine Fork]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/build-unreal-fork)

#### Next: [Set up]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-setup)
