# Get started
## 3 - Set up a project: The Example Project 

This guide takes you through setting up the [Example project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject); you will launch a single-server local deployment to test the project on your development machine, and you will launch a single-server deployment in the cloud to test and share the project. 

The project contains gameplay and assets that are representative of a basic first-person shooter running on SpatialOS. If you want to make your own project from scratch, use the [Starter Template]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/starter-template/get-started-template-intro).

Before starting this tutorial you _**must**_ follow:

- [Get started 1 - Get the dependencies]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies)
- [Get started 2 - Set up the fork and plugin]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/build-unreal-fork)
