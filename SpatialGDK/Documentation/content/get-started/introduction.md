# Get started: Introduction

We recommend you start by following the set up guide to get SpatialOS and the GDK's dependencies, the SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork, and the Multiserver Shooter tutorial. In the tutorial you can deploy to the cloud and experience a simple shooter game  running across two servers.

After this, you can either set up and deploy the Starter Project which you can use as a base for your own Unreal project running on SpatialOS or, if you have an existing Unreal multiplayer project, you can follow our detailed porting guide to get it onto the GDK and running on SpatialOS.
