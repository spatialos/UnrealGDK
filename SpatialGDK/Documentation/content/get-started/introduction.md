# Get started
## Introduction

Get started with the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal by building the GDK's Unreal Engine fork and setting up a project. You can set up either or both of the following projects: </br>

* **The Example Project** is a session-based FPS game. It gives an overview of the GDK and using SpatialOS, including deploying your game to SpatialOS in the cloud and locally on your development machine - useful for testing during development. The Example Project is the basis for the GDK tutorials.
</br>
</br>
* **The Starter Template** is a template project you can use as a base to create your own new project running on SpatialOS.

</br>

## Tutorials and guides

After you set up the GDK and the Example Project, you can check out the following tutorials:

* **Multiserver offloading**: Learn how to offload groups of Actors so Unreal server functionality is split between multiple servers using the Example Project.
* **Multiserver zoning**: Implement shooting across the boundaries of different servers computing one game world using the Example Project. (**Note:** Zoning is in preview.)
* **Database sync worker**: Learn how to integrate server database synchronization into your project using the Example Project.

</br>
You can also find out how to port a project to the GDK:

* **The porting guide**: Port your existing UE project to SpatialOS.
