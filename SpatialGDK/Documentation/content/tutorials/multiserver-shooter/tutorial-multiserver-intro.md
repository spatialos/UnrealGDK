## Multiserver Shooter tutorial

<%(Callout type="warn" message="This tutorial is available as a preview to demonstrate early multiserver functionality in the GDK. Please note we do not yet recommend development of multiserver games. For more information, please follow our [development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1) and [Unreal features support]({{urlRoot}}/unreal-features-support) pages.")%>	

**What the tutorial covers**<br/>
In this tutorial you’ll implement cross-server remote procedure calls (RPCs) in a simple first person shooter example project. The end result will be a multiplayer, cloud-hosted Unreal game running across multiple [server-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#inspector) that players can seamlessly move between and shoot across. It will look something like this:

The exercise demonstrates that the workflows and iteration speed you’re used to as an Unreal developer are almost entirely unaltered by the GDK: it’s just like regular Unreal!
