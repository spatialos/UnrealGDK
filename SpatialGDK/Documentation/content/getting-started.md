# SpatialOS GDK for Unreal documentation

## How to get started
We recommend you start by following the [Installation and setup guide]({{urlRoot}}/setup-and-installing.md) to set up the GDK for Unreal, the SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork, and the Starter Project (or your own Unreal project).

After you've run through the setup guide (including setting up Actor replication), take a look at the following pages, which explain some of the key concepts to understand when developing SpatialOS games:

* [Actor handover]({{urlRoot}}/content/handover-between-server-workers.md)
* [Singleton actors]({{urlRoot}}/content/singleton-actors.md)

To get some background on the GDK, you can check out [our blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/spatialos-unreal-gdk-pre-alpha).
