# SpatialOS concepts: introduction

The SpatialOS concepts section is a 10-minute read outlining the key concepts you need to understand when working with SpatialOS. Each page builds on content in the previous pages, so we recommend reading them in order.

If you want to skip the concepts and dive right in, you can follow the [Get started guide]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/introduction).
