# Welcome to the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Alpha
<%(Callout type="warn" message="This is an alpha release of the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal. The API may change as we learn from feedback. Although not fully ready in terms of performance, stability and documentation, this is a great time to get involved and shape it with us. We are committed to improving the GDK rapidly, aiming for a more stable release in Q2 2019: see [Development Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/7wtbtwmL/spatialos-gdk-for-unreal-roadmap). If you are interested in developing with the GDK before this time, please contact us. For more information please see [Recommended Use]({{urlRoot}}/recommended-use).")%>

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is a plugin which allows you to host your game and combine multiple dedicated server instances across one seamless game world, whilst using the Unreal Engine networking API. 

The GDK offers:<br/>

* **Multiserver support:** leveraging our cloud platform, the GDK enables you to use more than one Unreal game server in a single instance so that games can have more players, Actors, and gameplay systems than previously possible. <br/>
* **An Unreal-native experience:** keeping traditional workflows and networking APIs that Unreal Engine developers are familiar with, the GDK introduces new native-feeling concepts that turn a single-server engine into a distributed one. This enables the GDK to retain the functionality of the networking features which Unreal offers out of the box, including transform synchronization, character movement, and map travel.<br/>
* **An easy way to get started:** we have made sure it’s easy to [get started]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/introduction) with the GDK by including a Starter Project which you can use as a tour of SpatialOS and a base for your own game, as well as a guide to porting your current multiplayer Unreal game to run on SpatialOS.

## What next?
