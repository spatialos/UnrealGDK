<%(Callout type="warn" message="This is an alpha release of the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal, pending significant stability, performance and documentation improvements.

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is a plugin which allows you to host your game and combine multiple dedicated server instances across one seamless game world, whilst using the Unreal Engine networking API. 

The GDK offers:<br/>

* **Multiserver support:** leveraging our cloud platform, the GDK enables you to use more than one Unreal game server in a single instance so that games can have more players, Actors, and gameplay systems than previously possible. <br/>
* **An Unreal-native experience:** keeping traditional workflows and networking APIs that Unreal Engine developers are familiar with, the GDK introduces new native-feeling concepts that turn a single-server engine into a distributed one. This enables the GDK to retain the functionality of the networking features which Unreal offers out of the box, including transform synchronization, character movement, and map travel.<br/>
* **An easy way to get started:** we have made sure it’s easy to [get started]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/introduction) with the GDK by including a Starter Project which you can use as a tour of SpatialOS and a base for your own game, as well as a guide to porting your current multiplayer Unreal game to run on SpatialOS.
