## Unreal GDK terms

### Actor handover
 Handover is a new `UPROPERTY` tag. It allows games built in Unreal which uses single-server architecture to take advantage of SpatialOS’ distributed, persistent server architecture. See [Actor and entity property handover between server-workers](./handover-between-server-workers.md).

### codegen
Legacy system for generating interop code from SpatialOS. See “interop code” listing below and the [SpatialOS documentation on codegen](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.1/shared/spatial-cli/spatial-worker-codegen).

### Global State Manager
The Global State Manager (GSM) makes sure that Singleton Actors are replicated properly, by only allowing the server-worker with [authority](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.1/shared/glossary#read-and-write-access-authority) over the GSM to execute the initial replication of these Actors. See documentation on [Singleton Actors](./singleton-actors.md).

### GSM
Short for "Global State Manager".

### ICG
Short for “Interop Code Generator”.

## interop
Short for “interoperable” and “interoperability”. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5300383/interoperability).

### Interop Code Generator
An Unreal toolbar plugin which takes a set of Unreal classes and generates routing code (called "type bindings") that enables automated communication between Unreal and SpatialOS. See documentation on [Interop Code Generator](./interop.md).

### interop code
The contents of ` .schema` files and `SpatialTypeBinding` files which the Interop Code Generator creates. See the [SpatialOS website documentation’s .schema introduction](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/schema/introduction) for more information.

### Singleton Actor
A server-side authoritative Actor that is restricted to one instantiation on SpatialOS. See documentation on [Singleton Actors](./singleton-actors.md).

### type bindings
Generated by the Interop Code Generator, type bindings link SpatialOS entities and components to Unreal Actors and components. The type bindings are `SpatialTypeBinding` files and usually stored in `<Project Root>/workers/unreal/Game/source/<GameName>/Generated/` (where `Project Root` is the root of you project and `GameName` is the name of your game). See documentation on [Interop Code Generator](./interop.md).
