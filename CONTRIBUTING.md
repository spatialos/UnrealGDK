## Contributions policy

We welcome contributions, subject to the signing of our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Our CLA is the licence on which our contributors submit their contributions to us. The purpose of this is to grant us, Improbable, the right to use those contributions. This is an industry standard process for accepting contributions, as it creates clarity between both parties about the licence terms for any contributions.

The terms of the CLA are set out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6CKLzAF0ahqVURSTVdZS29MYXg5VWkzdFRHNmY2S25keHJj/view?usp=sharing), please ensure that you review these terms prior to submitting any contributions.

If you wish to submit a contribution on the terms of our CLA, please contact cla@improbable.io to receive a copy of the CLA to sign and return to Improbable.
